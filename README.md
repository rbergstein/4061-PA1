## Changes to Makefile

Added an "-lm" to link with the math library correctly.

## Individual Contributions: 

Ryan: Created a group github repository to collectively work out of and set up the project files and README document. Started work on the logic for 'utils.c'.

Marwa: Polished off the logic for 'utils.c' and created the logic checks needed in 'merkle.c'.

Basma: Did the final debugging for the 'utils.c' file, and wrote the plan for Markle Tree.

## Plan for Merkle Tree:

We are going to work on the Markle Tree root comutaion together. In child_process.c, we will split up the 
TODO sections. We will all debug together and attend office hours when help is needed.
